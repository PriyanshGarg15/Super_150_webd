javascript is the only programming lang.(where we write logic) that is understand by web browser.
It is a interpreted(line by line),weakly typed,dynamically typed,single threaded programming language.
> WEAKLY TYPED: where the data type is not fixed
    let umar=4; or let umar = "chaar"
> DYNAMICALLY TYPED: at run type data type is defined
> SINGLE THREADED :ek time pe ek kaam hoga,multiple task not possible.
BROWSER: Used to send request to server.
Primitive: 
     smallest possible division , which cannot be further broken down.(Building block of your program)

>Camel Case:
eg: let venuGopalIyer="Readability";
>Snake Case:
eg: let venu_gopal_iyer="saanp";
>kabab case:
eg: let venu-gopal-iyer="bhokal";(it is not used in JS as '-' not used in variable)
